  🖥️About the Project
</h1>
<div>
  <p1>
  Nihilists Server Manager makes use of the CustomTkinter library in order to take a more modern approach to Minecrafts older Server Manager.
  The aim of the project was to take everything great about the old manager and remaster it with some much needed improvements!
  Unlike Minecrafts old Server Manager, Nihilists Server Manager entirely handles everything needed to start your own server! (except port forwarding). - see how: https://thebreakdown.xyz/how-to-port-forward-for-a-minecraft-server/<br>
  Starting a game is as simple as opening Nihilists Server Manager giving it the path to your server file and hitting start!

  🔎 Whats included?
</h1>
<div>
  <p1>
    The original Server Manager had a lot of great stuff! The aim was to keep these elements and improve where necessary! The items included:<br>
    - Shows the device IP Address (To make it easier when it comes to port forwarding!)<br>
    - Shows the Device Status: - CPU, Memory, Disk<br>
    - Agrees to the EULA (The server file cannot be opened unless this has been agreed to! Don't worry, The Server Manager handles this 😄!)<br>
    - Enables RCON  (This is so commands can be sent back and forth)<br>
    - Checks Network Ping Then relays it back to a box to keep it nice and tidy<br>
    - Handles Server Shutdown on close!

      This server manager assumes you have already port forwarded for people using the Minecraft Java Server for the first time. Follow the instructions below:<br>
    - Open Nihilists Server Manager and provide the absolute path in the text box allocated<br>
