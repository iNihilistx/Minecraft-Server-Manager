How to:
- Make sure you have port forwarded before you attempt to play online with friends (You don't need to, if you're using it offline).
- Make sure the Minecraft Server file is named "server".
- Make sure the path to file is absolute! It should resemble someething like: "C:\Minecraft-Server\World1"
- Server Manager will handle: command execution, Rcon connection, Eula agreement, binding Rcon to host address.
